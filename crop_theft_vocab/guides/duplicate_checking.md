# Duplicate Checking

Duplicate checking helps avoid mining the same word twice.

## Yomitan

By default, Yomitan will alert you of cards containing the same word you have just searched. This does not need any special configuration.

When a word is not a duplicate, you will see a green button ![](../images/yomitan_add_button.svg).

When it is a duplicate, by default, you will see a purple double button ![](../images/yomitan_add_duplicate_button.svg). You may also see a grayed out button ![](../images/yomitan_add_disabled_button.svg) or an orange overwrite button ![](../images/yomitan_overwrite_button.svg) depending on your settings. All of these indicate that the word you have scanned is already present in the deck.

To further configure duplicate checking in Yomitan, open the settings page and enabled `Advanced` settings on the left sidebar. The duplicate checking settings will appear under the `Anki` category.

## Jidoujisho

Jidoujisho does not do duplicate checks by default. To configure them follow these steps:

1. Open the `Dictionary` tab on the bottom bar.

2. Click the settings cog near the top towards the right side of the search bar.

3. Click `Manage Duplicate Checks`.

4. Enable all decks that you want to check for duplicates in.

5. Click `Save` and `Close`.

Duplicates are indicated by the add button turning from white ![](../images/jidoujisho_add_button.png) to red ![](../images/jidoujisho_add_duplicate_button.png).
